Programming Assignment 2 for R Programming


`makeCacheMatrix` is a list containing a function to:

* set the value of the matrix: `set`
* get the value of the matrix: `get`
* set the inverse of the matrix: `setinverse`
* get the inverse of the matrix: `getinverse`

`cacheSolve` is function to compute the inverse of the special "matrix" returned by `makeCacheMatrix` above. If the inverse has already been calculated (and the matrix has not changed), then cacheSolve should retrieve the inverse from the cache.
